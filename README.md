# Starter (Minimal Static Site)

This is a minimal static site you can deploy to **GitHub Pages** with no build step.

## Quick start

1. Create a repo named **`YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`** (replace with your GitHub username).
2. Put these files in the repo and commit to the `main` branch.
3. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**  
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**  
   - Branch: `main` / **root**
4. Visit **https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io** (first deploy can take ~1–2 minutes).

## Customize
- Edit `index.html` and `about.html`.
- Update links and your email.
- Add images to `assets/img` and reference them like `/assets/img/photo.jpg`.
- (Optional) Add a `CNAME` file with your custom domain name if you have one.
